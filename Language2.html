		<p class="pr">C++ is a general-purpose programming language developed by Bjarne Stroustrup as a C programming language extension or 'C with classes.' The language has grown dramatically over time, and in addition to facilities for low-level memory manipulation, modern C++ now has object-oriented, standardized, and functional functions. It is almost always implemented as a compiled language, and several vendors have compilers for C++, including the Free Software Foundation, LLVM, Microsoft , Intel, Oracle, and IBM, and it's available on many platforms. C++ has been developed with a bias towards system programming and embedded, resource-constrained software and large systems, with performance , quality, and usability as highlights of its design. C++ has also been found to be useful in many other ways, with main strengths being network infrastructure and resource-constrained applications, including mobile applications, video games, servers (e.g. e-commerce, Internet search, or SQL servers), and performance-critical applications ( e.g. telephone switches or space probes).</p>
